      <h2>Our Focus</h2>
      <p class="tag">We focus on your challenges to tailor a product to your need.</p>
      <p><span class="b">We donâ€™t do template-limited design.</span> Some of the biggest web development companies offer user-friendly editors for those willing to commit to their infrastructure and frameworks indefinitely. Many other firms will take your logo, throw it into one of those templates, and sell it as if they'd actually done work on your website.</p>
      <p><span class="b">What we offer is a client-centered approach.</span> We take the business needs of your project into consideration and construct a product to fit what you're seeking. We make note of how your project can grow as needs change and we make it straightforward to extend your web presence when that happens. There is always open communication for you or your company with us throughout the process, and we'll nudge you toward whatever options would work best for you (<span class="i">even if they're not with us.</span>)</p>

      <h2>Our Workflow</h2>
      <p class="tag">We use modern technologies to solve modern problems.</p>
      <p>As our role in your project can vary based on your concept, our workflow is quite different between clients. The best way to get started with us is to fill out our contact form, introducing us to your general idea. Someone will follow up with you and schedule a meeting where we can get to know you and dig deeper into your concept to generate some project requirements. Afterward, we will research options to best suit the need at hand and report back once we have a good idea of what might be needed. From there onward, where we go is your call and we're here to support.</p>
